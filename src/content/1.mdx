## Design Environment for Teleoperation User Interface of Tinkered Soft Robots
### Tags
<TagGroup tags={['Research', 'Engineering']} />
### Description:

I implemented the algorithm proposed in my research, which involved advanced control strategies for teleoperation of tinkered soft robots.
Additionally, I developed a desktop application using C# and WPF to facilitate both experimental setups and practical applications.
This application includes features such as real-time data visualization, user-friendly interface (PoseUI) for controlling the soft robots, and logging capabilities for detailed analysis of the experiments.
