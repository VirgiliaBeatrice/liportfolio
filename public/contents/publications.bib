  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an asymmetric teleconference system using stuffed-toy robot as the representative of the remote user. Our main goal is to realize the system that can provide natural conversation both on the remote and the local side without immersing the user into a virtual environment. We consider envelope feedback gesture as the significant part to realize natural interaction, specifically turn-taking, eye gazing and beat gesture. We use stuffed-toy robot as the avatar robot because it can move very fast as well as increase familiarity and improve the interaction due to its softness structure. Furthermore, softness structure also brings safety and robustness because it will not be easily broken. In the remote side, we use wearable sensor and eye-tracking sensor to capture remote user's movement, thus enabling him/her to move and interact naturally as well. We conducted the teleconference experiment to evaluate our system. The result suggested that our system can improve the experience of the teleconference, especially in turn-taking aspect and transferring the beat gesture.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a method to allow casual users to create task-oriented control user interfaces (UIs) for cable-driven soft robots without prior knowledge, and the extra time and labor costs in measurements or calibration. The task space created by the proposed method is that it no longer must be physics-based, which provides more freedom, especially for casual users. Any control UI created previously could be used to create new UIs. We also develop a graphical user interface (GUI) implementing the proposed method for a feasibility evaluation. Practical cases that use the proposed GUI to create control UIs for particular tasks of a cable-driven soft robot arm system have been investigated. Finally, we conduct a concise user evaluation to test the usability of the proposed method for casual users.},
